Add stardates to your wordpress weblog

== Description ==

A powerful versitale lightweight stardate plugin with a wide array of functionalities for integrating stardates with your wordpress blog.

* URL `%stardate%` permalink rewrite support for posts.
* Filter various date functions, to have them display stardate instead, or filter nothing at all, and use the...
* `<?php the_stardate() ?>` function (or `<?php get_the_stardate() ?>`) inside of your themes, to get posts stardate.
* Aapproximate stardate based on several different formulas and variants and sources (like trekguide and wikipedia), including XI (for modern movies), Star Trek Online,  as well as Classic (from TNG, VOY ...).
* Shortcodes: `[stardate]` will expand to the current timestamp in stardate fmt.

The [stardate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/stardate/) plugin by croakingtoad is supported to wordpress 3.0.5, and has not been updated in five years. Therefore this plugin reincorporates the features of that stardate plugin and adds more functionality besides.


== Installation ==

1. unpack the zip into the `/wp-content/plugins` dir
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu
1. From the options menu, configure the thing and press "make it so".
1. press the "Generate stardates" button to associate stardate with all old posts.


== Screenshots ==

1. Default theme using stardate "Classic" format with the "override_get_date" setting.
2. URL with `/blog/%stardate%/%postname%/` in the permalink structure.


== Changelog ==

= 1.0.4 =
Fix so that get_the_stardate may be called with no params (same as get_the_date). Fix formatting

= 1.0.3 =
Fix so that you can override get_the_date only when no formatting params are passed to it (which makes it work nicely with the default teams which uses `get_the_date` in the `<date>` tag for the post.)

Test for 4.7.4

= 1.0.2 =
Minor refactoring

= 1.0.1 = 
Added Star Trek Online (SOL) stardate fmt. from comment by MartinSayles
